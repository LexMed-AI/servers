### D. 204.00 Maximum sustained work capability limited to heavy work (or very heavy work) as a result of severe medically determinable impairment(s)

The residual functional capacity to perform "heavy work" or "very heavy work" includes the functional capability for "work at the lesser functional levels" as well, and represents "substantial work capability" for jobs in the national economy at all skill and physical demand levels. Individuals who retain the functional capacity to perform "heavy work" (or "very heavy work") ordinarily will not have a severe impairment, or will be able to do their past work-either of which would have already provided a basis for a decision of not disabled. Environmental restrictions ordinarily would not significantly affect the range of work existing in the national economy for "heavy work" (or "very heavy work"). Thus, an impairment which does not preclude "heavy work" (or "very heavy work") would not ordinarily be the primary reason for unemployment, and generally is sufficient for a finding of not disabled, even though age, education, and skill level of prior work experience may be considered adverse.
